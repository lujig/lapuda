The flags of the programme:
	-t		time domain
	-f		frequency domain
	--nchan	number of frequency channels
	--nsub		number of sub-integrations
	-T		time scrunch and reserve only one sub-integration
	-F		frequency scrunch and reserve only one frequency channel
	-B		bin scrunch and reserve only one bin
	-P		reserve only the Stokes parameter I
	--tr		the time range of the data used in the programme
	--sr		the sub-integration range of the data used in the programme
	--fr		the frequency range of the data used in the programme
	--cr		the channel range of the data used in the programme
	--pr		the polarization indices of the data used in the programme
	--br		the phase range of the data used in the programme
Above flags and the corresponding properties are conventionalized, and other correspondance is not permitted.

In the information of LD format file, the following fields in parameters are defined:
	freq_start		the frequency of the lower edge of the first frequency channel
	freq_end		the frequency of the upper edge of the last frequency channel
	stt_time		the corresponding time as the same phase as the leading edge of the first data bin at infinity frequency
	chan_weight		the weight for the data each channel (except the last sub-integration)
	weights		the weight for each data bin
