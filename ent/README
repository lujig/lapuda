This is just a little game writen with Python, and it can be treated as an Easter egg.

It is a pity that the game is unfinished. I had planned 10 chapters for the game, and only 3 chapters is made up so far.
The first 3 chapters are respectively Gluttonous Snake, Tetris and Break the Bricks, while some new elements are added, hmmm...

Use "python ./game.py" or just "./game.py" to start the game.

You can choose a slot to create a new record, and choose a difficulty to begin the chapter 1. 
The next chapter will be unlocked after achieving level 10 in the current chapter.
The progress will be recorded, and it will be loaded while opening the game next time.

Have a good time!

PS: the idea to put this game within DFPSR is inspired by a chat with Pan Zhichen, and according to him there is also an Easter egg in the routine RPPPS.
